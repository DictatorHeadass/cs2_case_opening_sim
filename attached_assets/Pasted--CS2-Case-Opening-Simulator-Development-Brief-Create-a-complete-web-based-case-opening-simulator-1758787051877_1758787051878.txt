Key Implementation Notes:

Use realistic CS2 drop rates and item values across all 15 cases
Each case should have 15-25 unique items with different rarity distributions
Implement proper RNG for case opening with weighted probabilities
Create engaging visual feedback for rare drops (screen effects, sound cues via CSS)
Build scalable data structure to easily add new cases and items
Include market price fluctuations that simulate real trading dynamics
Higher-tier cases should have better drop rates for rare items to justify cost

Goal: Create an addictive, polished simulator with extensive variety that captures the excitement of CS2 case opening while building a complete virtual economy players can engage with for hours across 15 different case types.
